# Rtsian

![](rtsian.gif)

A game about tanks that shoot each other and get lost when pathing from A to B. This just a toy program.

Windows version in releases. For other targets, should be easy to build yourself.

## Controls

Mouse - like you'd expect in an RTS.

Keyboard:

* Q - self-destruct selected units
* W - add green tank
* E - add red tank

## Build

If you have go install, just `make`.
